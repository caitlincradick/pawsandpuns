# ABSTRACT
The project aims to address the issue of stress and burnout among Turing School students by creating an application that delivers random dad jokes along with cat images, providing moments of laughter and relief. The primary goal is to shift students' focus from frustration to humor, fostering a more positive mindset. The target audience includes overwhelmed Turing students who share an affinity for dad jokes and have an appreciation for cats. By crafting comprehensive user personas, we've personalized the app's design and features to cater to the specific needs and preferences of these individuals. We're utilizing APIs such as "https://icanhazdadjoke.com" and "https://cataas.com/cat" to source our content, and we've successfully incorporated data fetching within the frontend application. The MVP will allow users to access random jokes and cat images, favorite jokes, view saved jokes, and easily toggle between saved and unsaved status. Through this project, we aim to create a lighthearted platform that brings joy and humor to the lives of stressed students.

# Learning Goals
- Showcase proficiency in React, Router, Asynchronous JavaScript, and end-to-end testing using Cypress.
- Create user personas and stories to tailor the application to a specific niche audience, solving their unique problem.
- Utilize an API to display relevant data for the target audience and enable user interactions like favoriting.
- Design a responsive app that seamlessly adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes, implementing PropTypes for component props.
- Refine skills with Router to create seamless user experiences, facilitating effortless navigation throughout the pages.


# Challenges/Wins
-  I encountered a challenge in Cypress where I received an error message that I had never seen before. This error was new to me, so I turned to the Cypress documentation to find a solution. After researching and implementing the guidance from the docs, I was able to resolve the issue, effectively eliminating the error and improving the test's reliability.
- One of the biggest wins in the project was successfully implementing the favoriting and unfavoriting functionality. It required intricate synchronization between user interactions and API calls, ensuring that the data remained consistent and accurate. This feature not only enriched the user experience by enabling personalization but also showcased my ability to manage complex state changes and asynchronous operations effectively.
